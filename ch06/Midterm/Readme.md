# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
MY program draws a red bird with hair and glasses from the video game "Don't Touch the Spikes"
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
Whenever I tried to fill in the bird's nose, there was always fill color going onto the birds body.
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
turtle documentation
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
At first I was trying to draw glasses, then I wanted to draw frankenstein, but then I changed my mind and my drawing kind of looked like a bird from "Don't Touch the Spikes" so I settled on that.
My first function is also over 10 lines because I was trying to draw both eyes with only one function.
