# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
My program is supposed to use the Breaking Bad Quote api to print a random quote from a random Breaking Bad Character, Then, whoever says the quote has their name extracted using the Breaking Bad api to print that character's attributes in the show. However, the Breaking Bad api is non-functional, so I had to change my program. Now, the code is more interactive in console where it prints a random breaking bad quote which is supposed to choose your Breaking Bad character, and then you choose from 500 bob's burgers characters and that will be which character is most like you in Bob's Burgers. After that, you must choose between two quotes and which one speaks to you more and a print statement will show depending on your choice also printing the Breaking Bad character that was chosen for you.
